# Logistic-Regressiom

This is a logistic regression model which is trained on two variables X1 and X2. If you find an error in the logic or code of the program, 
please make a pull request. I would be very grateful and you would be helping a humble newbie enter this new world he is trying to explore.

To run the code, copy and paste the script and save it as a .py file. Open command prompt and type python followed by the name of the file. 
This of course assumes you have python 3.7.3 installed on your device. If not, you can do so from the python.org website. Also, the code
uses numpy as a dependency, which can be downloaded by typing pip install numpy into the command prompt terminal. 

This is just my second program in machine learning; and it is very very crude. It is not focused on efficiancy, as I am just grasping these
beautiful concepts for the first time. With utmost humility, if you can improve the code or educate me in a small way or two, please do so.
